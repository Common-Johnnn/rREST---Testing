            <div class="about-content">
                <p>To explain what rREST is, first imagine your brain can operate at 3 levels. Brain 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0.</p>
            <p>Brain 1.0 is ruled by the most ancient part of our brain, the amygdala, and is often referred to as the lizard brain. This brain can get triggered any time we feel stress, anxiety, frustration, anger, or fear. When this happens, our base instincts and survival behavior take over and we seem to lose all control.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="about-items">
            <img src="assets/img/rrest-brain2.webp" alt="">
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>Then there’s brain 2.0, which is more evolved than the lizard brain. It is goal-oriented and can often help us create results and a sense of success. This brain needs to make more money, have more stuff, gain more influence, and just do more and more. Brain 2.0 eventually leads to burnout.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="about-items">
            <img src="assets/img/rrest-brain3.webp" alt="">
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>rREST can take us to Brain 3.0 – the wise, integrated brain. This brain is fully functional and can bypass the shortcomings of the amygdala, triggering our old fears. Brain 3.0 can look beyond the short-term success often dictated by society. This brain can tap into your soul’s desire, which truly makes you happy. Most importantly, Brain 3.0 is brilliant. It is happy, stable, and capable of balancing logic with desire. It is the integration of the right and left brain.</p>
            <p>How does rREST do this? rREST permanently quiets the emotionally unpleasant childhood memories hidden away in our amygdala and it does so without you actually having to relive those traumatic experiences.</p>
